# Modeling Intelligent Agents for Emergent Behavior in Games
This work is a study on the field of emergent narrative that uses autonomous agents to simulate living organisms in order to recreate a functional ecosystem, where each creature has its own desires and needs, and is aware of its surroundings. The current high-level goals are:
- to explore the emergence of narrative from the interaction of many small self-contained units in a virtual world (i.e. a bottom-up approach);
- to provide simple yet representative implementations of many cognitive processes of animals (e.g. the *fight-or-flight* mecanism, working memory, learning, etc);
- to create an agent framework that is generic enough so it can be used in other projects as a way to simulate the minds of living beings in a given environment;
- to develop a sandbox platform where the results of the study can be viewed and experimented with.

This is part of my final project for the Computer Science BSc degree at UFRRJ, and is made under the orientation of DSc Bruno Dembogurski.
