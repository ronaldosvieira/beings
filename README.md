This work is a study on the field of emergent narrative that uses autonomous agents to simulate living organisms in order to recreate a funcional ecosystem, where each creature has its own desires and needs, and is aware of its surroundings. The goals of this work are:
- to explore the emergence of narrative from the interaction of many small self-contained units in a virtual world (i.e. a bottom-up narrative approach);
- to provide simple yet representative implementations of many cognitive processes of animals (e.g. the *fight-or-flight* mecanism, working memory, learning, etc);
- to create an agent framework that is generic enough to be reusable in other projects as a way to simulate living beings' minds in an environment;

This is part of my final project for the Computer Science BSc degree at UFRRJ, and is made under the orientation of DSc Bruno Dembogurski.
